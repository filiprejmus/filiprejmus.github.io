I am a Graduate student in Computer Science at Berlin Institute of Technology. While my academic work is very math heavy and focussed on Deep Neural Network explainability and Computer Graphics I am currently diving into the Observability of Kubernetes Cloud Environments. Above that is my love for great flat whites and basketball 🏀
